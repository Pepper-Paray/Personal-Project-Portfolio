# Personal-Project-Portfolio

## Assignment-Objective

The goal of this assignment is to consolidate the use of Components and Props by creating a professional showcase. You will practice mapping dynamic data to present your work—whether it’s the tasks from this week or other projects you have hosted on GitHub.

## Detailed-Instructions

Step 1: Project Setup: Initialize a clean project using npm create vite@latest. Clean up the default files and styles to start from scratch.

Step 2: Component Architecture: Inside the src/components folder, create a ProjectCard.jsx component. This component should receive via props: title, description, and a link.

Step 3: Data Selection: In your App.jsx, create an array of objects representing your projects. You can choose to showcase the tasks completed during this week OR any previous projects you already have in your GitHub profile.

Step 4: Dynamic Rendering: Use the .map() method to iterate through your array and render a ProjectCard for each project. Ensure each element has a unique key.

Step 5: Layout & Navigation: Use CSS (Flexbox or Grid) to organize the cards. Each card must include a clear button or link that leads to the GitHub repository or the live demo.

Step 6: Personal Touch: Add a header with your name and a brief "About Me" section to make it a true personal portfolio.
